# YOLO-Based-Framework-for-Unsafe-Human-Vehicle
The proposed system computes adaptive distance thresholds based on vehicle size and classifies interactions as safe or dangerous. Experimental evaluation on real-world street images demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential risk scenarios while maintaining real-time performance.
